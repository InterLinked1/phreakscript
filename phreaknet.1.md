# NAME
phreaknet - install, enhance, configure, and manage Asterisk and DAHDI

# SYNOPSIS
**phreaknet** *command* [*OPTION*]

# DESCRIPTION
**phreaknet** automates the installation, maintenance, and debugging of Asterisk and DAHDI
while integrating additional patches to provide the richest telephony experience. The utility
automatically installs any necessary prerequisites as part of operation.

It also contains tools to automate the process of setting up a new node on PhreakNet
(hence the utility's name). However, it can be used to set up any generic Asterisk system.

PhreakScript installs the latest LTS (Long Term Servicing) version of Asterisk along with
the latest releases of DAHDI Linux and DAHDI Tools (if the -d or --dahdi options are specified).
Many additional bug fixes, features, enhancements, and improvements are also provided to provide
the best Asterisk and DAHDI experience.
