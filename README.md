PhreakScript is also useful for:
- automating installation and maintenance of Asterisk, Asterisk Test Suite, Asterisk Test Framework, DAHDI Linux, DAHDI Tools, and related resources
- validating Asterisk configuration
   - can find common syntax errors in dialplan code
   - can find missing audio files referenced by the ``Playback``, ``BackGround``, and ``Read`` applications
   - suggests optimizations that can be made to dialplan code to make it more readable and efficient
- generating Asterisk user documentation
- debugging Asterisk configuration
- generating core dumps
- automating PhreakNet boilerplate dialplan installation

> [!NOTE]
> [1] Currently, PhreakScript installs the latest LTS version of Asterisk. However,
    when a standard release is the most recent release, it may be installed by default.
    To install a specific major version, you can specify it explicitly e.g. `--version=22`.

> [!NOTE]
> PhreakScript is primarily an automation tool, but it also adds a significant amount of functionality to Asterisk beyond what is available upstream, making it a superset of "vanilla Asterisk". We aim to upstream our patches whenever practical; in fact, we are among the most active and frequent contributors to the Asterisk and DAHDI projects. This repository includes enhancements that are not available upstream as well as those that may be in the future but are not currently. A list of upstreamed Asterisk patches can be found at https://phreaknet.org/changes

### Installation

In a nutshell, run:

**Linux:**

```cd /usr/local/src && wget https://docs.phreaknet.org/script/phreaknet.sh && chmod +x phreaknet.sh && ./phreaknet.sh make```

**FreeBSD:**

```pkg install -y wget && cd /usr/local/src && wget https://docs.phreaknet.org/script/phreaknet.sh && chmod +x phreaknet.sh && ./phreaknet.sh make```

> [!WARNING]
> BSD is not recommended for Asterisk, see below.

Then, you can use PhreakScript. Run ```phreaknet help``` or ```phreaknet examples``` to get started.

For a basic install, you can run `phreaknet install`. This installs all the pre-requisites for Asterisk and then downloads and builds Asterisk, completely non-interactively.

To install with DAHDI, run `phreaknet install --dahdi` (add `--drivers` to also restore drivers that were removed upstream in DAHDI 3).

For a guided, interactive installation, you can also run `phreaknet wizard`. The wizard will determine what installation options are best for you, based on your preferences. However, the wizard tool is not comprehensive for all available options.

For further details, please refer to the Docs: https://docs.phreaknet.org/#phreakscript

> [!TIP]
> There are a plethora of flags available that modify the installation process in various ways. It is highly recommended that you run ```phreaknet help``` and spend some time reading through the available options to craft the installation command that is appropriate for your system. Flags are available for most commonly used installation scenarios.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> PhreakScript must be run as root, even if Asterisk will not be installed to run as root.

> [!CAUTION]
> PhreakScript is primarily supported on Debian-based Linux systems, and DAHDI and Asterisk are best supported on these platforms.
> Limited support is available for other Linux distros (Fedora, RHEL, Rocky Linux, SUSE, Arch Linux, etc.).
> Extremely limited support exists for FreeBSD, and BSDs (and UNIX in general) are not recommended for running Asterisk/DAHDI - use Linux instead if possible.
